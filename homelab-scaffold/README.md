Homelab Scaffold
================

This repo was generated by scaffold.sh and contains a basic layout for your 6-node homelab + cloud stack.

IMPORTANT:
 - Fill in secrets: copy each nodes/<node>/.env.example -> nodes/<node>/.env and set TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY, DB passwords, etc.
 - Tailscale: install tailscale on hosts and connect them into same machine account or use auth keys.
 - Traefik/Authentik: the edge is intended for cloud; configure DNS to your cloud VM.
 - Promtail: edit nodes/*/config/promtail.yaml to set exact Loki Tailscale IP if different.
 - Semaphore: adapt tooling/semaphore/semaphore-pipeline.yml to your Semaphore runner.

To deploy (example local deployment):
  cd nodes/edge-sec-cloud && docker compose up -d
  cd ../automation-devops && docker compose up -d
  ...
Or use Semaphore to run the included pipeline.

If you want me to:
 - expand any docker-compose with more env var details,
 - create production-ready Traefik & Authentik configurations,
 - generate Terraform/Ansible playbooks to provision VMs & DNS,
 - create Prometheus exporters & Grafana dashboards

tell me which and I'll produce them next.
